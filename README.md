# Mage Knight (Tragic Edition v3) - a Tabletop Simulator Mod

This is my github for my Mage Knight Mod, Edition3 for TTS. Your welcome to use it and any code found here as you like. 

This mod uses my growing Library of tools and code snippets extensively. As I am modifying and making my mods it is getting constantly updated. It contains scripts and snips code I use all the time as well as some large form tools like my Trashcans. These files are required for modifying my code.

There is a very good mod on the workshop for Mage Knight called ![Mage Knight : Highly Scripted](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1721301081) made by a guy called Tuff. Long, long ago Tuff asked me if he could use my Mage Knight mod and rebuild it. He did so and has since remade most of the component scans and stuff. Very little of my original code is left. I strongly recommend using that mod. It is astoundingly good.

The thing is I like my old mod, I like how it plays and I like how the mod is not as automated. I have put in a number of quality of life things, but it still plays kinda like a board game, as in you need to move things about yourself and get into the systems of the game, rather than having the mod do it all for you. It is just a personal preference thing and how I like to play. Also I am getting into designing my own expansion for Mage Knight and wanted a place to be able to easily test it. As one of the problems with super complex scripted mods is that you can not use your own custom rules, unless they are scripted intro the mod for you.

Anyway, I am not sure this version of the mod will get many users, it is mainly for me. Though if you want to use it, I hope you enjoy it!

Have Fun and ROLL SIGNS<br>
